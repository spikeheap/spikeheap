# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior technical architect at the [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice), where among other things I help build the [Prisoner Content Hub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/prisoner-content-hub). 

At work I'm an advocate for boring tech and making life simple, safe, and predictable for ourselves.

I use this account for work, community, and tinkering.
