# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lead technical architect at the [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov).

At work I'm an advocate for boring tech and making life simple, safe, and predictable for ourselves.

I use this account for work, community, and tinkering. 

You can find me in a few places:
