# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CTO-for-hire. For a while I worked in the [Government Digital Service](https://github.com/alphagov) GOV.UK team and at [Ministry of Justice](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk).

At work I'm an advocate for boring tech and making life simple, safe, and predictable for ourselves.

I use this account for work, community, and tinkering, and of course any opinions are my own and not representative of any employer or client. 

You can find me in a few places:

- [Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@spikeheap)
- ~~Twitter~~
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ryanpbrooks)

Just remember [Github is not your CV](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/).
